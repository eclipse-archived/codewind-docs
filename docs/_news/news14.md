## Codewind 0.14.0
Thursday 9, July 2020

#### ✨ New Features and Highlights for 0.14.0 ✨

##### VS Code and Eclipse

##### VS Code
- The [changelog](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind-vscode/wiki/Changelog#0140-july-2020) file is updated for Codewind 0.14.0. 
- With [secure template sources](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind/issues/2647), template sources that require authentication can now be added to Codewind. Provide authentication with a username and password or use an access token.
- Link Codewind projects together with [project linking](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind/issues/2852).
  - When you link a project to another project, the project that is the link target has the other project's hostname exposed in an environment variable that you define.
  - For example, linking **Project A** to **Project B** through the `PROJECT_A` environment variable means that **Project B** can access the code of the `PROJECT_A` environment variable to get the current hostname of **Project B**. Then, **Project A** can use **Project B**.
- The Project Overview page has undergone [another visual update](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind-vscode/pull/620).
- You can [right-click many fields](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind/issues/1153) in the Project Overview and Template Sources pages to copy the values.
