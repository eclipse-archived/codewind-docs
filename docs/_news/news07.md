## Codewind 0.7.0
Wednesday 18 December 2019

#### ‚ú® Remote Deploy with Codewind: Tech Preview ‚ú®

You can now develop your code locally and securely build and deploy your apps in the cloud! Why is this cool?
- Free up local resources. üëè
- It's secure! üîê We use [Keycloak](https://keycloak.org/) to secure the connection between your local editor and remote cloud deployment.

Curious? [Learn more](remote-deploying-codewind.html)!

#### New Features and Highlights for 0.7.0

**Monitoring Updates**
- You can now [inject metrics](https://github.com/codewind-resources/design-documentation/blob/master/codewindServer/metricsInjection.md) into your Node.js, Spring, and WebSphere Liberty MicroProfile projects. You can [enable or disable](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind/issues/1290) this feature with just a click.
- Effortlessly [visualize data](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind/issues/977) like CPU usage, memory footprint, and web traffic on the included application monitoring dashboard at the click of a button. Codewind hosts the dashboard, so displaying the graphs won't eat into your project's resources. 

**OpenShift Do (odo)**
- You can now easily import existing projects into Codewind and [use odo](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind/issues/1115) to build and deploy projects to your OpenShift or OKD cluster.
- Codewind now [supports Java templates](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind/issues/450), and Java projects can build and deploy after they have been [configured](che-odo-support.html).

**Docker**
- You can now specify any [Docker registry secret](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind/issues/1178) required by Codewind within the Codewind extension for the editor.
