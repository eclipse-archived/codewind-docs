Monday 16 December 2019

#### ‚ú® Remote Deploy with Codewind: Tech Preview ‚ú®

You can now develop your code locally and securely build and deploy your apps in the cloud! Why is this cool?
- Free up local resources. üëè
- It's secure! üîê We use [Keycloak](https://keycloak.org/) to secure the connection between your local editor and remote cloud deployment.
