Today we proudly present the next release of Kabanero, version 0.5.0. Check out the changes we have for you.

== Github OAuth integration

From the console you can now configure user GitHub OAuth authorization. This allows a user to log in with their GitHub ID and manage their collections through the Kabanero Console UI. Until now, a user can only view their collections and their current status. There is more to come with this feature in upcoming releases so stay tuned.

== Tekton Triggers

The pipelines provided by Kabanero now leverage Tekton triggers.   Tekton trigger support in Kabanero enables execution of pipelines and tasks based on specific Github events. The lifecycle of microservice development is reflected by the developers interaction with Git. Git push, merge, tag, pull requests all reflect well-known points in that microservice's lifecycle. Due to this change, if you have existing webhooks created in a previous version, you will need to delete them and recreate them.

In addition to these changes, we have improved code quality and fixed many small bugs. Checkout more of what's new in the https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-operator/releases/tag/0.5.0[0.5.0 release of the Kabanero Operator].

We hope you enjoy this new release!
