= What’s Hot this week?
Nathan Ziemann <https://github.com/nateziemann>

This week we’re really looking to heat up app development for Kubernetes.  Check out new announcements, ways to engage with us and get hands-on. 

 1. Today we are announcing more details about Kabanero and our Kabanero Developer Experience with new open source projects from Eclipse Foundation and IBM.  Check out this latest blog on IBM Developer with all the details!! https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/cloud-native-apps-kubernetes-kabanero/[Build cloud-native apps faster for Kubernetes with Kabanero.] 
 
 2. We’re introducing “Try it” experiences. Our first is the Kabanero Developer Experience, focused on the developer persona and local dev.  Check out how to get hands-on at https://kabanero.io/try-it.   In under 5 minutes you can go from zero to application running in an existing Knative/Kubernetes cluster.  Watch the new YouTube demo and try-it for yourself.
 
 3. We will be at https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or[O’Reilly OSCON] this week in Portland talking about Kabanero and our Kabanero Development Experience with Eclipse Codewind and Appsody.  If you’re at the conference, stop by the IBM Booth and check us out.  We’d love to hear from you.  We’ll have technical experts ready to share, demo and listen to your feedback. 

In addition, check out our GitHub repos. https://github.com/kabanero-io If you want to collaborate with developers, get involved, that’s the place to start.


== Stay tuned, we’re just getting started.

We plan to share first guides and another “Try it” experience, first featured collections, and more details about each open source project integrated as part of Kabanero.
