# Codewind for Eclipse

You can use [Codewind for Eclipse](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/codewind) to develop and debug your containerized projects from within Eclipse.

Use the Eclipse IDE to create and make modifications to your application, see the application and build status, view the logs, and run your application.  Codewind for Eclipse supports development of Microprofile/Java EE, Java Lagom, Spring, Node.js, Go, Python and Swift containerized projects. In addition, Microprofile/Java EE, Spring, and Node.js applications can be debugged.

The Eclipse tools are [open source](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind-eclipse). You are encouraged to browse the code, open issues, and contribute.

To get started, see [Getting started with Codewind](mdteclipsegettingstarted).

To uninstall Codewind, see [Uninstalling Codewind for Eclipse](mdteclipseuninstall)
