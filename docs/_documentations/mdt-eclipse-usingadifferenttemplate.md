# Configuring template sources

When you create a new project, you can choose from the default set of templates available, or you can choose from a template source of your own. Use Codewind to manage templates. Templates can make application development easier by providing a structure and boilerplate code to help get a new project started.

- To open the Template Source Manager, right-click **Projects (Local)**.
- Click **Manage Template Sources** to add a source to the table.
- You can perform the following actions in the dialog window:
  - Use the check boxes to enable or disable sources.
  - Use **Add** to add a new source.
  - Use **Remove** to remove non-default sources.
