# Building Codewind projects

When auto build is enabled for a project, Codewind for Eclipse detects when you make a change and starts a build automatically. If you have disabled auto build for the project, you can start a build manually when you have made a change or a set of changes:

1. Right-click your project in the **Codewind Explorer** view and select **Build**.
2. Wait for the project state to return to **Running** or **Debugging** in the **Codewind Explorer** view and then test your changes.
