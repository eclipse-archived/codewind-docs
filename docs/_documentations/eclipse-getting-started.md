# Getting Started with Codewind

There are three ways of using Codewind - locally, remotely or as a hosted application on the cloud. To get started, **you can try out Codewind by using the local configuration**. In this configuration, you create, develop, build and run your containerised applications on your local machine using your local IDE.

Follow the instructions to get started with using Codewind locally. This will guide you through:

1. Installing Codewind into your IDE on your local machine
2. Creating your first project
3. Making a code change to try out the inner loop experience

Select your IDE to get started:

* [VS Code](./vsc-getting-started.html#installing-codewind-for-vs-code)
* [Eclipse](./eclipse-getting-started.html#installing-codewind-for-eclipse) 
* [IntelliJ](./intellij-getting-started.html#installing-codewind-for-intellij)

**Codewind on Eclipse Che** If you want to go straight to using Codewind as a hosted application in the cloud, follow [these instructions](./che-installinfo.html).

**Using Codewind Remotely** If you want to use Codewind remotely, you must first [follow the step to install Codewind locally](#installing-codewind-for-vs-code). By [using Codewind remotely](./remote-codewind-overview.html), Codewind is configured for making code changes on your local IDE but building and running your application in the cloud. Once you have installed Codewind remotely, you can proceed to either:

1. Deploy Codewind to your cloud if not already done so by you or a sysadmin/DevOps engineer. See tutorial [Deploying Codewind Remotely](./remote-deploying-codewind.html).
2. Connect your Codewind extension of your local desktop IDE to Codewind in your cloud by following the tutorial [Using Codewind Remotely](./remote-codewind-overview.html).

**The different configurations of Codewind** To find out about the different ways of using Codewind - locally, remotely, or as an application hosted on the cloud - see [Codewind Architecture](./overview.html#architecture).

### Installing Codewind for Eclipse

Install Codewind for Eclipse to develop your containerized projects from within Eclipse.  

To install Codewind for Eclipse, complete the following steps:

1. Download and install the latest [Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/) or use an existing installation.
    - Install Eclipse IDE Version 2019-09 R (4.13.0) or later to avoid [Bug 541220](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=541220).
    - **Note:** The earliest supported version of the Eclipse IDE is Version 2019-06 (4.12).
2. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) 17.06 or later. If you use Linux, you must also install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
3. If you are installing Codewind on Windows, enable your local drive for sharing in Docker. To do this, open the **Docker Settings** window, click the **Shared Drives** tab, and select the drive on which you are installing Codewind. 
4. Install [Codewind from Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/codewind).
    - [![Drag to your running Eclipse workspace. ](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/sites/all/themes/solstice/public/images/marketplace/btn-install.png)](http://marketplace.eclipse.org/marketplace-client-intro?mpc_install=4638524 "Drag to your running Eclipse* workspace. *Requires Eclipse Marketplace Client") Drag this install button to your running Eclipse workspace.
       - **Note:** You must have the Eclipse Marketplace Client.
    - To install from the Eclipse IDE, complete the following steps:
        1. Open the Eclipse IDE and navigate to **Help**>**Eclipse Marketplace**.
        2. Search for `Codewind`.
        3. Click the **Install** button.
        4. Finish the wizard and accept licenses as needed.
        5. When the installation is complete, restart Eclipse.
5. Open the Codewind view. 
    - Navigate to **Window**>**Show View**>**Other...**>**Codewind**>**Codewind Explorer**
6. Codewind requires the installation of additional Docker images to run.  Double-click the **Codewind** item in the Codewind Explorer view to complete the installation. The installation might take a few minutes to complete.

### After installation

**Getting started with Codewind - next steps** Continue to instructions for [creating your first Eclipse Codewind Project](./eclipse-firstproject.html).

**Installing Codewind for remote use** If you intend to use Codewind [remotely](./remote-codewind-overview.html), you have now completed the pre-requisite step of installing Codewind on your local machine and can proceed to:

1. Deploy Codewind to your cloud if not already done so by you or a sysadmin/DevOps engineer. See tutorial [Deploying Codewind Remotely](./remote-deploying-codewind.html).
2. Connect your Codewind extension of your local desktop IDE to Codewind in your cloud by following the tutorial [Using Codewind Remotely](./remote-codewind-overview.html).
