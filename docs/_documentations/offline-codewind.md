# Using Codewind offline

When you have limited or no Internet access, you can continue to work on projects in Codewind provided that:

- The project was created and had run successfully before, while you had Internet access
- You only make changes to your code without pulling in new dependencies
- You do not remove docker images of your projects that Codewind has built on your system

## These projects can be worked on offline

- Appsody Kitura
- Appsody LoopBack 4
- Appsody Python Flask
- Go
- Lagom Java
- Open Liberty
- Python
- Spring Boot
- WebSphere Liberty MicroProfile
