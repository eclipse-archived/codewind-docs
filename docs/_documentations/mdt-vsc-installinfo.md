# Installing Codewind for VS Code

The Codewind installation includes two parts:
1. The Eclipse plug-in installs when you install Codewind from the VS Code Marketplace or when you install by searching in the **VS Code Extensions** view.
2. The Codewind back end containers install after you click **Install** when you are prompted. After you click **Install**, the necessary images are downloaded from the internet. The download is approximately 1 GB.

The following images are pulled. These images together form the Codewind back end:
- `eclipse/codewind-initialize-amd64`
- `eclipse/codewind-performance-amd64`
- `eclipse/codewind-pfe-amd64`
- `codewind-initialize-amd64`
- `codewind-performance-amd64`
- `codewind-pfe-amd64`

## Using Codewind
When the installation is complete, the extension is ready to use, and you are prompted to open the Codewind workspace. For more information about using Codewind, see [Tutorial: Codewind for VS Code](mdt-vsc-tutorial.html).

## Removing containers and images
To remove Codewind, see [Uninstalling Codewind from VS Code](mdt-vsc-uninstall.html).
