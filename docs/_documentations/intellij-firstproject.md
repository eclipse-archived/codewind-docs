# Creating your first Codewind project with Codewind for IntelliJ

## Creating your first project from a template
1. Start IntelliJ. From the welcome page, click **Create New Project**. The **New Project** window opens.
2. Create a Codewind project by clicking **Codewind**.
   - If Codewind isn't installed yet, click **Install Codewind** to complete the installation.
   - If Codewind isn't running yet, click **Start Codewind**. A **Starting Codewind** window appears.
3. After Codewind is installed and started, click **Next**. A list of available templates appears.
   - Currently, IntelliJ supports only the Java language templates.
4. Click the template of your choice. Then, click **Next**.
5. Enter the **Project name:** field to name your project and enter the **Project location:** field to choose where to put it.
6. Click **Finish**. A window for your project appears.
7. IntelliJ detects a `pom.xml` file and asks if you want to add the file as a Maven project. In the **Non-managed pom.xml file found:** notification, click **Add as Maven Project** to create the correct project structure.
   - The **Non-managed pom.xml file found:** notification might disappear after some time. To create the correct project structure, go to the IntelliJ project view and right-click the `pom.xml` file. From the context menu, click **Add as Maven Project** to create the correct project structure.
8. To access the Codewind view, click the **Codewind** tab. From the Codewind view, right-click your project to open an application, start a build, and more.

## Creating more projects from templates
If you have an IntelliJ project already open, you can create more projects.
1. Either go to **File**>**New**>**Project...** or right-click the **Local** node in the Codewind view.
2. Then, click **New Project...** and continue with creating a Codewind project by following the steps in [Creating your first project from a template](#creating-your-first-project-from-a-template).

## Removing a project
1. If you delete a project, it is removed from Codewind.
2. However, the files remain in the file system, and you need to manually delete them.

Congratulations, you have now created, built and run your first Codewind project using Codewind on your local machine.
