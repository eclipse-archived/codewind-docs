5\. Codewind now starts to build and run your very first project. This process initially takes several minutes, depending on the speed of your network and the selected project.

Once complete, the following screen shows your application is built and running.

Congratulations, you have now created, built and run your first Codewind project using Codewind on your local machine.

## Next Steps

Choose from the following:

**Getting started with Codewind - next steps** Continue to instructions for [making a code change with Eclipse](./eclipse-codechange.html) to see the auto-build-and-run feature in action.

**Installing Codewind for remote use** If you intend to use Codewind [remotely](./remote-codewind-overview.html), you have now completed the prerequisite step of installing Codewind on your local machine and can now proceed:

1. Deploy Codewind to your cloud if not already done so by you or a sysadmin/DevOps engineer. See tutorial [Deploying Codewind Remotely](./remote-deploying-codewind.html).
2. Connect your Codewind extension of your local desktop IDE to Codewind in your cloud by following the tutorial [Using Codewind Remotely](./remote-codewind-overview.html).
