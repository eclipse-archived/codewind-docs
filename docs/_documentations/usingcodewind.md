# Using Codewind

After you install Codewind, you can begin to work with projects.

## Working with projects

You can use Codewind to [create a new project](creatingaproject) or [import an existing one](importingaproject). Projects appear in the [project list](projectview). You can [check the application status and build status](checkingstatuses) of your application.

You can then [edit your code](edityourcode) by using a [development environment of your own](settingownide). Now, when you make a change to your project, Codewind detects the change and automatically rebuilds and redeploys the updated project for testing. You can also [performance test your project](performancetesting).

If you have many projects on the go at the same time, you can focus resources on those you are currently developing by [disabling development on others](disabledevelopmentonprojects).

## What next
Develop a project of your own, or explore Codewind with [tutorials and samples](tutorials-and-samples).
