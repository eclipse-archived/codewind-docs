# Making a code change with VS Code
<br/>
Codewind automatically builds and redeploys your application whenever you make a code change and save the file.

To see this feature in action, make a change to the getting started example.

1\. Edit the `index.html` file:

2\. In the file, find the `Congratulations!` line.

3\. Change the heading from `Congratulations` to `I did this`:

The status of the project changes to **Stopped** while the project is rebuilt and deployed:

After a few moments, the status changes back to **Running**:

4\. Click the **Open Application** icon to show your code change running:
