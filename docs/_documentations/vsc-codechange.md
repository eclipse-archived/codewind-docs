# Making a code change with VS Code
<br/>
Codewind automatically builds and redeploys your application whenever you make a code change and save the file.

To see this feature in action, make a change to the getting started example.

1\. Edit the index.html file:

![](dist/images/vsc-codechange.png){:width="800px"}

2\. Navigate to the bottom of the file to find the lines:

3\. Change the heading from *Congratulations* to *I did this*:

The status of the project changes to *stopped* while the project is rebuilt and deployed:

After a few moments, the status changes back to *running*:

4\. Click the **Open App** icon to show your code change running:
