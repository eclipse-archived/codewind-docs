# Connecting VS Code to remote Codewind

Complete the [prequisites](./remote-codewind-overview.html). 

## Objectives

In this topic you will:
1. Connect Codewind on VS Code to the remote instance of Codewind in the cloud. 
2. Add an image registry.

## 1. Connect your IDE's Codewind extension to your remote instance of Codewind.

1\. Locate the Codewind view in VS Code and click the cloud icon to launch the new connection wizard:

![New Connection](./images/remotevs/newConnection.png)

2\. Add a connection name and press **Enter**.

![Name Connection](./images/remotevs/connectionName.png)

3\. Complete the three required fields: Gatekeeper URL, user name, and password. Then **Save**.

![Required Fields](./images/remotevs/connectionCreds.png){:width="600"}

The IDE validates the connection and adds it to the Codewind panel:

![Validate settings](./images/remotevs/connectionAdded.png)

The IDE and Codewind are connected.

## 2. Add a deployment registry.

Before projects can be deployed on Kubernetes, specify a Docker Registry. This example uses Docker Hub: 

1\. If it's not already open, go to the connection details page with the link:

![Docker Registry](./images/remotevs/connectionSettings.png)

2\. Locate and click **Open Container Registry Manager**:

![Open Registry Manager](./images/remotevs/registryManager.png)

3\. In the image registry screen, click **+ Add New**:

![Adding Registry](./images/remotevs/ImageRegistries.png){:width="600"}

4\. Complete the Docker connection details. For example, if you are using Docker Hub, enter `docker.io` and press **Enter**:

![New Registry](./images/remotevs/newReg1.png)

Enter:

- Your Docker Hub user name
- Your Docker Hub password
- Your namespace, which is usually the same as your user name

The connection is tested to validate your credentials and stored in a Kubernetes secret within the Codewind service.

## Next Steps

You have now finshed configuring Codewind to be used remotely. 

In the next topic, you will learn how to [use Codewind remotely to create and import projects](./remotedeploy-projects-vscode.html).
