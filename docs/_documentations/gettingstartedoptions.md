# Which Getting Started option should I choose? 

Codewind helps you to develop, build, and deploy your app wherever you want. You can choose to edit, build, and run your app locally, or in the Cloud.

## Local

If you want to develop your apps locally, choose a local option. You can use your favourite IDE on your machine to develop your apps, and Codewind can build and run these locally for you. 

## Cloud

If you prefer to develop your apps in the Cloud, choose the Cloud option. You can use the Cloud-based IDE of your choice, and you can develop your apps and build and deploy these fully in any Cloud.
