# Which Getting Started option should I choose? 

Codewind helps you to develop your app wherever you want by supporting three primary development scenarios:
1. Locally in VS Code or Eclipse.
2. Remotely in the Cloud using Eclipse Che.
3. Hybrid, which uses a combination of both local and remote development. 

In all three scenarios, Codewind helps you by doing all the hard work of building your apps into high quality deployable applications in containers. You can then deploy these containers anywhere into a Kubernetes environment. 

## Local development

Local development is where you install and use Codewind on your machine in your preferred IDE. When you install Codewind locally, it downloads everything it needs and you can then use it to help you develop your applications. 

Codewind detects changes to your code and automatically rebuilds it. Your code is compiled together with any dependencies into readily deployable containers that are located locally on your machine. 

## Remote development

Remote development is where you install and use Codewind in the Cloud in Eclipse Che. You can use this option to help you to develop your applications wholly off premises.

You install Eclipse Che in the Cloud, install Codewind in the Cloud, create the Codewind workspace, and then edit your applications in the Cloud.

Codewind detects changes to your code and automatically rebuilds it. Your code is compiled together with any dependencies into readily deployable containers that are located in the Cloud. 

## Hybrid development

Hybrid is a combination of both local and remote development. Use this option to host your code locally and build and deploy your applications in the Cloud. 

You install Codewind locally in your preferred IDE, install Codewind in the Cloud, and then create a Codewind workspace. You then edit your applications locally. 

Codewind detects changes to your code and automatically rebuilds it. Your code is compiled together with any dependencies into readily deployable containers that are located in the Cloud.
