# Commands overview: Codewind for VS Code

All commands provided by this extension are available in the [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette). You can also right-click the **Codewind view** to invoke most commands with the context menu. 

Some commands apply to individual projects, others like **Start** and **Stop** apply to Codewind as a whole. Run a command from the Command Palette to view a list projects on which you can run the command. Additionally, the list might be filtered depending on the command. For example, the **Disable project** command runs only on projects that are **Enabled**.

Commands are separated into categories. See the following pages:
- [Project commands](vsc-commands-project.html)
- [Restart and debug](vsc-commands-restart-and-debug.html)
