# Configuring template repositories

When you create a new project, you can choose from the default set of templates available, or you can choose from a template repository of your own. Use Codewind to manage templates. Templates can make application development easier by providing a structure and boilerplate code to help get a new project started.

- To open the Template Source Manager, right-click **Projects (Local)**.
- Click **Add New** to add a repository source to the table.
- Enable or disable a repository type to view the repositories of that type in the wizard.
