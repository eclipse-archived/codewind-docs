# Making a code change
1. From the Explorer Projects view, find the project you want to edit and open the file you want to change.
2. Edit the file.
3. Save your changes.
4. In the Codewind Project Explorer view, Codewind detects the change and updates the build status. Codewind builds and deploys the project to incorporate your update.
