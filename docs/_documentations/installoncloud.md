# Setting up a Codewind-ready install of Che

To setup a Codewind-ready install of Che, follow these instructions. Alternatively, the install script at https://github.com/eclipse/codewind-che-plugin/tree/master/setup/install_che can be used instead.

7. [Updating the version](#updating-the-version)

## Prerequisites
- Set up the PersistentVolume (PV) with either Network File System (NFS) or GlusterFS.
  - For NFS, if running on IBM Cloud Private, follow these instructions:[NFS Storage Install Instructions](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/fe25b4ef-ea6a-4d86-a629-6f87ccf4649e/entry/Working_with_storage?lang=en) and use 777 permissions for the folders.
  - You do not need to set up the PV for local Kube, such as Minikube, Minishift, Docker Desktop, and others.
- Set up the ClusterRole.
  - **Important:** If you are installing Che with the `deploy_che.sh` script for OpenShift, do this step *after* installing Che.
  1. Clone the [Codewind Che plug-in repository](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind-che-plugin)
  2. Enter the `cd` command to go to the `codewind-che-plugin` repository.
  3. Run the `kubectl apply -f setup/install_che/codewind-clusterrole.yaml` command to create a cluster role with the required permission.
  4. Next, run the `kubectl apply -f setup/install_che/codewind-rolebinding.yaml` command.

## Installing Che with the operator

For instructions on installing Che with the Che operator, please see the [Eclipse Che operator on Operator Hub](https://operatorhub.io/operator/eclipse-che).

**Note:** Complete the following steps before you create your `CheCluster` custom resource.

1. Create the `eclipse-codewind` cluster role: `kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/codewind-che-plugin/master/setup/install_che/codewind-clusterrole.yaml`.

2. Ensure the following fields in your `CheCluster` `.yaml` file are set:
- The `spec.server.cheWorkspaceClusterRole` field is set to `eclipse-codewind`, which was created when you previously applied the Codewind ClusterRole.
- The `spec.storage.preCreateSubPaths` field is set to `true`.

## Setting up OKD and OpenShift

### Installing Che with deployment scripts

If the Che operator was not used to install Eclipse Che, follow these steps instead. Otherwise skip these steps:

1. Git clone the [Eclipse Che repository](https://github.com/eclipse/che).
2. Enter the `cd` command to go to the `deploy/openshift` directory.
3. Deploy Che with `./deploy_che.sh`.
4. From the [Codewind Che plug-in repository](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind-che-plugin) run the `kubectl apply -f setup/install_che/codewind-clusterrole.yaml` command to create a cluster role with the required permission.
5. From the [Codewind Che plug-in repository](https://github.com/eclipse/codewind-che-plugin) run the `kubectl apply -f setup/install_che/codewind-rolebinding.yaml` command.

### Enable privileged and root containers to run
Codewind is currently required to run as privileged (as it builds container images) and as root. Run the following commands to enable that functionality:
1. Enter `oc adm policy add-scc-to-group privileged system:serviceaccounts:eclipse-che` to enable privileged containers
2. Enter `oc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:serviceaccounts:eclipse-che` to enable containers to run as root.

## Setting up other Kubernetes

### IBM Cloud Private: Set the ClusterImagePolicy
If you're running on IBM Cloud Private, you must add the images that Che uses to the ClusterImagePolicy before deploying Che:
1. Log in to the IBM Cloud Private cluster.
2. Run the `kubectl edit clusterimagepolicy` command. Then, add the following lines:
  ```
  - name: gcr.io/*
  - name: docker.io/*
  ```

### Step 1: Setting up the Che Helm chart

If the Che operator was not used to install Eclipse Che, follow these steps instead. Otherwise skip these steps:

1. Clone the [Che repository](https://github.com/eclipse/che).
2. Enter the `cd` command to go to the `deploy/kubernetes/helm/che` directory. Then, edit the `values.yaml` file.
   - Set up multiuser if you need the multiple users feature: `multiuser: true`


### Step 2: Installing Che with the Helm chart
Clone the [Che repository](https://github.com/eclipse/che).
1. Enter the `cd` command to go to the `deploy/kubernetes/helm/che` directory.
2. Run the `helm dependency update` command.
3. Run the following command:
    ```
    helm upgrade --install che --namespace <ns> \
        --set cheImage=eclipse/che-server:7.0.0 \
        --set global.ingressDomain=<cluster proxy ip>.nip.io \
        --set global.cheWorkspaceClusterRole=eclipse-codewind \
        --set global.cheWorkspacesNamespace=<ns> \
        --set che.workspace.devfileRegistryUrl="https://che-devfile-registry.openshift.io/" \
        --set che.workspace.pluginRegistryUrl="https://che-plugin-registry.openshift.io/v3" ./
    ```
               
Append the `--tls` flag if the tiller is configured with SSL in your Kubernetes cluster.

## After installing Che

### Adding registries in Che
After Che is started and running, add the container registry that will be used with Codewind.
- On IBM Cloud Private, push your 
to any Docker registry *except* the internal Docker registry
- On OpenShift or other Kube platforms, you can push your images to any Docker registry, such as Dockerhub, Quay.io, Google Cloud Registry (GCR), and more.

Complete the following instructions to add the registries:
  - Server: `<registry-to-push-images-to>`
  - Username: `<Your username>`
  - Password: `<Your password>`

For further information on adding deployment registries to Che, consult our [registry documentation](https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/dockerregistry.html)

### Optional: Hosting a Devfile for creating the Che workspace with Codewind

Skip this step if you are using the devfiles that Codewind provides by default. If you wish to host your own devfile, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the [Codewind Che plug-in repositoryhttps://github.com/eclipse/codewind-che-plugin).
2. Make your modifications as you see fit.
3. The `devfile.yaml` and `meta.yaml` files need to be hosted in a location that Che can access, such as Github.
4. In `devfile.yaml`, modify the `codewind-sidecar` and `codewind-theia` components so that their ID formats match.
For example, `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/codewind-che-plugin/master/plugins/codewind/codewind-sidecar/0.3.0/meta.yaml
` and `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/codewind-che-plugin/master/plugins/codewind/codewind-theia/0.3.0/meta.yaml
` host the `meta.yaml` files.

## Creating the Codewind workspace

### Confirm the Docker registry secrets.
Confirm that you added the docker registry secrets in the Che dashboard. Go to **Administration**>**Add Registry** to check for the secrets.

### Creating the Codewind workspace with a Devfile
The general format for creating a Che workspace via a factory is:
```
http://<che ingress domain>/f?url=<hosted devfile URL>
```

We provide a ready-to-use devfile with the Codewind plug-ins. Enter the following URL to create a workspace from the devfile:
```
http://<che ingress domain>/f?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/codewind-che-plugin/master/devfiles/0.3.0/devfile.yaml
```

For other sample devfiles, see https://github.com/kabanero-io/codewind-templates/tree/master/devfiles

### Checking for the Codewind pod
1. If you are using the Terminal, switch to use the workspace namespace. You can check for the namespace with `kubectl get ns`.
2. Ensure the projects are cloned into the workspace. You might need to refresh the browser to trigger the clone.

### Configuring Codewind for Tekton pipelines
From your command line, enter the following commands if you want to use existing Tekton installations with Codewind:

```
oc apply -f setup/install_che/codewind-tektonrole.yaml
oc apply -f setup/install_che/codewind-tektonbinding.yaml
```

For more information about Tekton, see [Getting started with the Tekton Dashboard Webhooks Extension](https://github.com/tektoncd/experimental/blob/master/webhooks-extension/docs/GettingStarted.md).

## After installing Codewind

### Setting the Docker registry
Upon creating a Codewind workspace. The container registry to deploy your projects to must be set. When you go to create or add an existing project to Codewind, Codewind will prompt you for the registry. See (Docker registry docs) for guidance on using proper container registries

If you would like to change the registry that's used at any time, run the `Codewind: Set Deployment Registry` command in Theia to dynamically set a new registry for your workspace. <br>

![Set deployment registry](dist/images/che-docs/SetDockerRegistry-1.png){:height="90px" width="623px"}. <br>

![Set deployment registry location](dist/images/che-docs/SetDockerRegistry-2.png){:height="85px" width="633px"}. <br>

![Test deployment](dist/images/che-docs/SetDockerRegistry-3.png){:height="208px" width="801px"}. <br>

**Note:** To proceed, you need to have added the registry credentials with Che.
- Codewind restarts with the changes added.

## Using Codewind from the Che Theia IDE
