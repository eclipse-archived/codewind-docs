# Making a code change with Eclipse 
<br/>
Codewind automatically builds and redeploys your application whenever you make a code change and save the file.

To see this feature in action, make a change to the getting started example.

1\. Edit the `index.html` file.

2\. In the file, find the `Congratulations!` line.

3\. Change the heading from `Congratulations` to `I did this` and save the file.
