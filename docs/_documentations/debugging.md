# Debugging in Codewind

Complete the following steps to enable debugging in Codewind applications:

1. In the Codewind view, right-click a project and select **Restart in Debug Mode** from the menu.
2. Wait for the project state to switch to **Debugging**. After it switches to Debugging mode, the debugger is attached.
3. When in Debugging mode and when the debugger is attached, you can debug your application. Perform debug actions that are supported by the IDE that you are using.
4. While the project is still in Debugging mode, if the debug process is detached, right-click your project and select **Attach Debugger** from the menu. This action reattaches the debugger to the debug process, and you can continue with debugging your application.
5. To switch back to run mode, right-click your project and select **Restart in Run Mode** from the menu.
