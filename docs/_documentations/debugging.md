# Debugging in Codewind

Complete the following steps to enable debugging in Codewind applications:

1. In the Codewind view, right-click a project and select **Restart in Debug Mode** from the menu.
2. Wait for the project state to switch to **Debugging**. The first time that the project switches to **Debugging**, the debugger is attached.
3. When in debug mode, you can perform the debugging actions that are included with your IDE.
4. To switch back to run mode, right-click your project and select **Restart in Run Mode** from the menu.
5. If you want to return to debug mode after detaching or ending the debug process, right-click your project and select **Attach Debugger** from the menu.
