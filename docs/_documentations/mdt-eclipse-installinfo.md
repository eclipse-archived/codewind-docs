# Installing Codewind for Eclipse

The Codewind installation includes two parts:
1. The Eclipse plug-in installs when you install Codewind from the Eclipse Marketplace or when you install by searching in the **Eclipse Extensions** view.
2. The Codewind back end containers install after you click **Install** when you are prompted. After you click **Install**, the necessary images are downloaded from the internet. The download is approximately 1 GB.

The following images are pulled. These images together form the Codewind back end:
- `eclipse/codewind-initialize-amd64`
- `eclipse/codewind-performance-amd64`
- `eclipse/codewind-pfe-amd64`

## Using Codewind
When the installation is complete, the extension is ready to use, and you are prompted to open the Codewind workspace.

Codewind creates the `~/codewind-workspace` folder to contain your projects. On Windows, you can find the workspace at the `C:\codewind-workspace` folder. You can open the `codewind-workspace` or a project within the workspace as your Eclipse workspace. For more information, see [Getting started: Codewind for Eclipse](mdteclipsegettingstarted.html).

## Removing containers and images
To remove Codewind, see [Uninstalling Codewind from Eclipse](mdteclipseuninstall.html).

## Troubleshooting
