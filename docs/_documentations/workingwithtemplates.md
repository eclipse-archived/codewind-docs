# Working with templates

Use Codewind to code and develop in languages of your choice by using templates. Templates make application development easier by providing a structure and boilerplate code, or framework, to help you start a new project. Templates appear as a new language and project type within the Codewind user interface.

When you create a new project, choose from the default set of templates available in Codewind, or choose a template source of your own. Add more development languages and sample projects by adding new templates.

Codewind provides preconfigured, containerized project templates covering several languages, including [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/), [Java](https://www.java.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [Swift](https://swift.org/) and several frameworks, such as [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), and [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io/). [Quickly create and deploy microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKMggp10gq4&t=12s) in languages and frameworks that you're familiar with. Easily modify these preconfigured projects to develop your customized microservices.

## Managing templates

The **Template Source Manager** provides template management in Codewind. To open the **Template Source Manager**, right-click a Codewind connection, then **Manage Template Sources**. The **Template Source Manager** appears.

- **Note:** **Template Source Manager** is the name used in VS Code. Eclipse uses the name **Manage Template Sources**.

Codewind templates are stored in the [codewind-resources/codewind-templates](https://github.com/codewind-resources/codewind-templates)
GitHub repository. Three examples are included in Codewind for your reference:
* Standard Codewind templates
* Default templates from Kabanero Collections
* Appsody stacks to develop applications with sharable technology stacks

Use the **Template Source Manager** to perform the following actions:

1. To add a new template source to the table, click **Add New**. For more information, see [Adding your template sources to Codewind](#adding-your-template-sources-to-codewind).
2. Remove non-default template sources.
   - **VS Code:** Click the trash icon.
   - **Eclipse:** First make sure you are in the **Manage Template Sources** wizard. Select the non-default templates you want to remove. Then click **Remove**.
3. Add templates to the wizard.
   - **VS Code:** Toggle the **Enabled** slide to **On** so template source templates appear in the **Create Project** wizard.
   - **Eclipse:** In the **Manage Template Sources** wizard, check the check boxes for the template sources you want to enable. After you're done, click **OK**. A notification appears that says, **Updating Template Sources: (0%)**. The message disappears after the wizard successfully sets your preferred template sources.
   - Use template sources to add style projects to Codewind.
   - For example, before adding an Appsody project, enable at least one Appsody-style template source.
4. Disable templates to prevent them from appearing in the wizard.
   - **VS Code:** To disable a set of templates so they do not appear in the **Create Project** wizard, toggle the **Enabled** slide to **Off**.
   - **Eclipse:** In **Manage Template Sources**, deselect the template sources you want to disable and click **OK**.

## Creating your own templates

Add your own template sources to use in the **Template Source Manager**.

- **Prerequisites:** Build and run templates that use languages and frameworks that are compatible with Codewind. Appsody, Maven, and Node.js styles built with Docker are supported.

1. Choose a GitHub repository to contain all of your new template sources.
   - Codewind uses [`codewind-templates/devfiles`](https://github.com/codewind-resources/codewind-templates/tree/master/devfiles).
2. Within this repository, create a folder for each template source.
   - For example, within the `devfiles` folder, Codewind has subfolders for template sources that include Go, MicroProfile, Lagom Java, and more.
3. Each template source folder needs a `devfile.yaml` file with the following information:

```yaml
apiVersion: <The version of the API that you use>
metadata:
  - name: <The name of your template>
projects:
  - name: <The name of your project>
    source:
      type: git
      location: <The GitHub URL of the template location>
```

4. In the same GitHub repository where you saved the template source folders, create an `index.json` file. In this file, add the following values for each of the templates that you want to work with in Codewind:

```json
{
  "displayName":"<The name of your template>",
  "description":"<The description of your template>",
  "icon":"<The SVG graphic to be associated with your template>",
  "language":"<The programming language that your template is written in>",
  "projectType":"<The project type of your template>",
  "location":"<The Git repository where the template itself is located>",
  "links": {"self":"<The template devfile.yaml>" }
}
```

- For an example `index.json` file, see the [`index-json` file](https://github.com/codewind-resources/codewind-templates/blob/master/devfiles/index.json) in the `codewind-templates` repository.
5. To add the templates to Codewind, open your IDE and access the **Template Source Manager**.

## Adding your template sources to Codewind

Add your template sources to Codewind with the **Template Source Manager**.

1. Add the template.
   - **VS Code:** In the **Template Source Manager**, click **Add New**.
   - **Eclipse:** Right-click the connection in the Codewind Explorer view and select **Manage Template Sources...**. After the **Manage Template Sources** wizard appears, click **Add...**.
2. Enter the URL and any other information.
   - **VS Code:** Enter the URL to your template source `index` file and click **Enter** to confirm.
   - **Eclipse:** Fill in the fields for **URL**, **Name**, and **Description**. Click **OK** when you're done.
