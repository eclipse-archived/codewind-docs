# Working with templates

Codewind gives you the flexibility to code and develop in languages of your choice by using templates. Templates make application development easier by providing a structure and boilerplate code, or framework, to help you start a new project. Templates appear as a new language and project type within the Codewind user interface. 

When you create a new project, you can choose from the default set of templates available in Codewind, or you can choose a template source of your own. You can add more development languages and sample projects by adding new templates. 

Codewind provides preconfigured, containerized project templates covering several languages, including [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/), [Java](https://www.java.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [Swift](https://swift.org/), and several frameworks, such as [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), and [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io/). [Quickly create and deploy microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKMggp10gq4&t=12s) in languages and frameworks that you're familiar with. You can easily modify these preconfigured projects to develop your customized microservices.

## Managing templates

Template management in Codewind is provided by the **Template Source Manager**. To open the **Template Source Manager**, right-click a Codewind connection, then **Manage Template Sources**. The **Template Source Manager** appears. 

- **Note:** **Template Source Manager** is the name used in VS Code. Eclipse uses the name **Manage Template Sources**.

Codewind templates are stored in the [codewind-resources/codewind-templates](https://github.com/codewind-resources/codewind-templates)
GitHub repository. Three examples are included in Codewind for your reference: 
* Standard Codewind Templates.
* Default templates from Kabanero Collections.
* Appsody Stacks to develop applications with sharable technology stacks. 

Use the **Template Source Manager** to perform the following actions:

1. To add a new template source to the table, click **Add New**. For more information, see [Adding your template sources to Codewind](#adding-your-template-sources-to-codewind).
2. **VSCode:** To remove non-default template sources, click the trash icon. 
   **Eclipse:** To remove non-default template sources, first make sure you are in the **Manage Template Sources** wizard. Select the non-default templates you want to remove. Then click the **Remove** button.
3. **VSCode:** Toggle the **Enabled** slide to **On** so template source templates appear in the **Create Project** wizard. 
   **Eclipse:** In the Manage Template Sources wizard, check the check boxes for the template sources you want to enable. Once done, click the OK button. You should see a notification in the bottom right saying **Updating Template Sources: (0%)**. Once that message disappears, it has successfully set your preferred template sources. 
   * Use template sources to add style projects to Codewind. 
   * For example, before adding an Appsody project, enable at least one Appsody-style template source. 
4. **VSCode:** To disable a set of templates so they do not appear in the **Create Project** wizard, toggle the **Enabled** slide to **Off**.
   **Eclipse:** In the Manage Template Sources, simply uncheck the template sources you want to disable, and then click OK. 

## Adding your template sources to Codewind

Add your template sources to use Codewind with the framework of your choice. 
1. Ensure your template source has an `index.json` file containing information about your new templates. Follow the same format as the `index.json` file found in [https://github.com/kabanero-io/codewind-templates/blob/master/devfiles/index.json](https://github.com/kabanero-io/codewind-templates/blob/master/devfiles/index.json).
2. **VSCode:** In the **Template Source Manager**, click **Add New**. 
   **Eclipse:** Right click on the connection in the Codewind Explorer view, and select **Manage Template Sources...**. Once the **Manage Template Sources** wizard pops up, click **Add...**.
3. **VSCode:** Enter the URL to your template source's index file and click `Enter` to confirm.
   **Eclipse:** Fill in the fields for URL, Name, and Description. Click the **OK** button once you are finished.
