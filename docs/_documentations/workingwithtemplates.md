# Working with templates

Codewind gives you the flexibility to code and develop in languages of your choice by using templates. Templates make application development easier by providing a structure and boilerplate code, or framework, to help you start a new project. Templates appear as a new language and project type within the Codewind user interface. 

When you create a new project, you can choose from the default set of templates available in Codewind, or you can choose a template source of your own. You can add more development languages and sample projects by adding new templates. 

Codewind provides preconfigured, containerized project templates covering several languages, including [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/), [Java](https://www.java.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [Swift](https://swift.org/), and several frameworks, such as [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), and [Open Liberty](https://openliberty.io/). [Quickly create and deploy microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKMggp10gq4&t=12s) in languages and frameworks that you're familiar with. You can easily modify these preconfigured projects to develop your customized microservices.

## Managing templates

Template management in Codewind is provided by the **Template Source Manager**. To open the **Template Source Manager**, right-click **Local** then **Manage Template Sources**. The **Template Source Manager** appears. 

- **Note:** **Template Source Manager** is the name used in VS Code. Eclipse uses the name **Manage Template Sources**.

Codewind templates are stored in the [codewind-resources/codewind-templates](https://github.com/codewind-resources/codewind-templates)
GitHub repository. Three examples are included in Codewind for your reference: 
* Standard Codewind Templates.
* Default templates from Kabanero Collections.
* Appsody Stacks to develop applications with sharable technology stacks. 

Use the **Template Source Manager** to perform the following actions:
1. To add a new template source to the table, click **Add New**. For more information, see [Adding your own template sources to Codewind](#adding-your-own-template-sources-to-codewind).
2. To remove non-default template sources, click the trash icon. 
3. Toggle the **Enabled** slide to **On** so template source templates appear in the **Create Project** wizard. 
    * Use template source templates to add style projects to Codewind. 
    * For example, before adding an Appsody project, enable at least one Appsody-style template. 
4. To disable a set of templates so they do not appear in the **Create Project** wizard, toggle the **Enabled** slide to **Off**.

## Adding your own template sources to Codewind

Add your own template sources to use Codewind with the framework of your choice. 
1. Ensure your template source has an `index.json` file containing information about your new templates. Follow the same format as the `index.json` file found in [https://github.com/kabanero-io/codewind-templates/blob/master/devfiles/index.json](https://github.com/kabanero-io/codewind-templates/blob/master/devfiles/index.json).
2. In the **Template Source Manager**, click **Add New**.
3. Enter the URL to your template source's index file and click `Enter` to confirm.
