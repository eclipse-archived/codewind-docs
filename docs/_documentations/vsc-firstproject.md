Congratulations, you have now created, built and run your first Codewind project using Codewind on your local machine.

## Next Steps

Choose from the following:

**Getting started with Codewind - next steps** Continue to instructions for [making a code change with VS Code](./vsc-codechange.html) to see the auto-build-and-run feature in action.

**Installing Codewind for remote use** If you intend to use Codewind [remotely](./remote-codewind-overview.html), you have now completed the prerequisite step of installing Codewind on your local machine  and can now proceed:

1. Deploy Codewind to your cloud if not already done so by you or a sysadmin/DevOps engineer. See tutorial [Deploying Codewind Remotely](./remote-deploying-codewind.html).
2. Connect your Codewind extension of your local desktop IDE to Codewind in your cloud by following the tutorial [Using Codewind Remotely](./remote-codewind-overview.html).
