## Installer fails with mount issues on Windows
If you try to install Codewind on Windows 10 and use Docker, you might see the following error:

```sh
ERROR: for codewind-performance  Cannot start service codewind-performance: b"error while creating mount source path '/host_mnt/c/codewind-data': mkdir /host_mnt/c: file exists"

ERROR: for codewind-performance  Cannot start service codewind-performance: b"error while creating mount source path '/host_mnt/c/codewind-data': mkdir /host_mnt/c: file exists"
Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
```

**Workaround:**
Enter the following command and install again:
1. Enter the `docker volume rm -f /host_mnt/c` command.
2. Restart Docker and run the installer again.

If the command and another installation attempt don't succeed, complete the following steps instead:
1. Uninstall Codewind and remove all the images with the `docker system prune -a` command.
2. From the Docker settings dialog box, reset Docker to the factory default to resolve the mount issues.

For more information, see [this issue about Docker mounts on Windows](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/1560).

## Docker Shared Drive not accepting OS credentials for Windows
When using OS authentication setups (for example, AzureAD), Docker Shared Drive might not accept your OS credentials.

**Workaround:** Create a new user account.
1. Navigate to **Settings** -> **Accounts** -> **Family & other people** -> **Add someone else to this PC** -> **I don't have this person's sign-in information** -> **Add a user without a Microsoft account**.
2. Create the new account with the same username but without the prefix (for example, if your AzureAD account is `AzureAD/BobSmith`, your new local account should be `BobSmith`). Use the same password as your other account.
3. Select your new local account and click **Change account type**. Select the dropdown menu and select **Administrator**. Share the drive again in Docker.

## Error appears after installing or updating Codewind
After you install or update Codewind, an error might appear when you try to start Codewind.

**Workaround:**
Remove the Codewind Docker images with your IDE:
1. Stop Codewind.
2. Remove the Codewind Docker images.
   - In VS Code, use the `Remove Codewind Images` command.
   - In Eclipse, use the `Uninstall` action.

If removing the images with the IDE fails, remove them with the Docker command line instead:
1. Stop Codewind.
2. Use `docker image ls` to identify the Codewind images.
3. Then, enter `docker image rm` to remove them.

If installing and starting Codewind still fails, you can use Docker system prune:<br>
**Caution:** Docker system prune removes more than just the Codewind Docker images. It can potentially remove all of your images.
1. Stop Codewind.
2. Enter the `docker system prune -a` command.
3. Carefully review the list of items that Docker system prune removes. Preserve any items that you want to keep.
   - To preserve containers, start all the containers that you want to save.
   - To preserve images, start a container from the images that you want to save.
4. After you ensure the preservation of any necessary items that Docker system prune removes, enter `y` to continue.

## Cannot find Codewind in Marketplace when attempting to install in IntelliJ
When attempting to install Codewind in IntelliJ, you cannot locate the Codewind plug-in in Marketplace, and if you verify the custom plug-in repository link, you get a `Connection failed` error message:

![intellij install error](images/intellij/custom-plugin-repo-connection-failed-error.png)

This error occurs because the custom plug-in repository link contains an additional space.

**Workaround**
Remove the extra space from the custom plug-in repository link.

## Projects stuck in starting or stopped state
You might occasionally see projects stuck in the `Starting` or `Stopped` state even though the container logs say the projects are up and running. This can happen when you create a number of projects, for example, using the default and Appsody templates with Codewind 0.5.0. 

**Workaround** Manually rebuild the projects that are stuck in `Starting` or `Stopped` state. To do this: 
1. In the **Codewind Explorer** view, right-click your project and select **Build**.
2. Wait for the project state to return to **Running** or **Debugging** in the **Codewind Explorer** view.

Action/Topic: Checking the application status 
Issue type: bug/info
Codewind version: 0.9.0
Issue link: https://github.com/eclipse/codewind/issues/1269
-->
## How to stop the app from continuously pinging 
With all the stacks and templates Codewind offers, some template applications come with no server, like Appsody Node.js. The backend in PFE expects all applications to have a server. Thus, the backend continuously pings the port of the application retrieved from the application's container information. Since no server is available to ping on that port, the application times out and is stuck on `Starting`. 

**Workaround** Disable the pinging of your application stuck on the `Starting` state:
1. Edit the `.cw-settings` file under the application, and set the key `internalPort` to `-1`. 
    - This key forces the application to stop, stops pinging the application, and bypasses the timeout error. 
2. Once you implement the server into the application, resume the application ping and run it by setting `internalPort` to `""` for the default port of the container. Or you can choose a specific port you want to ping.

## How to create a .cw-settings file if it does not exist
Prior to the 0.9.0 release, non-Codewind stacks, like Appsody and OpenShift Do (odo), did not come with a .cw-settings. If you have a project from those stacks from a previous release, you need to create the .cw-settings file. The file must reside under the project root directory. 

**Workaround** Create a template .cw-settings file with the following contents: 

```
{
"contextRoot": "",
"internalPort": "",
"healthCheck": "",
"isHttps": false,
"ignoredPaths": [
""
]
}
```

## Che and local projects build twice when you create a project
If you are using Codewind on Eclipse and VS Code at the same time, local projects build twice during project creation, resulting in longer project creation time.

**Workaround:** To reduce project creation time, do not use Codewind on Eclipse and Codewind on VS Code at the same time. Close either Eclipse or VS Code and then create your project.

## Application Monitoring unavailable after Project Import
After importing an application, when you click `App Monitor`, the dashboard is not displayed and results in a `Cannot GET /appmetrics-dash/` error. If this error appears, the application was not created by Codewind or previously had AppMetrics integration.

**Workaround:** Enable AppMetrics for your application. You can enable AppMetrics for [Node.js](https://developer.ibm.com/node/monitoring-post-mortem/application-metrics-node-js/), [Swift](https://developer.ibm.com/swift/monitoring-diagnostics/application-metrics-for-swift/), and [SpringBoot](https://github.com/RuntimeTools/javametrics#spring-boot) projects.

## Profiling markers do not appear
If you have the Codewind Language Server for Node.js Profiling extension enabled and have run a load test, profiling markers still might not appear. Ensure that your project and load run conform to the following requirements to use profiling:
- Your project exists in Theia or VS Code. Profiling is available only in Theia and VS Code.
- Your project is a Node.js project that was created through Codewind.
- Your project has `Run Load` executed on it.
- The load run successfully completed. Profiling data is written to the `load-test/<datestamp>/profiling.json` file in your Codewind project only on a successfully completed load run. If the load run was cancelled, it won't be written to the workspace.
- The load run ran for a minimum of 45 seconds to gather enough profiling data to generate the `profiling.json` file.
- If a function runs quickly, in less than 5 milliseconds with the default configuration, then the function might not run during any of the samples, so it might not be included in the profiling data for that load run.
- Profiling is not disabled. To enable profiling, access the profiling in one of the following ways:
  - Right-click in the editor and select `Toggle Profiling`.
  - Open the command palette with `cmd+shift+p` on a Mac or `ctrl+shift+p` on Windows. Then, select `Codewind: Profiling: Toggle Profiling`.
  - Toggle the `Codewind Profiling: Show Profiling` setting in the extensions settings.

**Workaround:** Review the preceding list and ensure that your project conforms to all of the items in the list.

## MicroProfile project gets updated twice upon file change
If you modify files in MicroProfile projects, sometimes the project gets double updates. You might see the application status changed from **Running** to **Stopped** twice. If you notice this status change, the default polling rate, which is 500 ms, is too short for the application monitor.

**Workaround:** Increase the polling rate in the `server.xml` file to 1000 ms or longer.

## Context Root / Application Endpoint not correct
If you create or bind a project that has a context root set in `.cw-settings`, such as a project using the Lagom template, the context root is not picked up initially. This also happens after restarting Codewind.

**Workaround** For Eclipse, add the context root to the URL in your browser. For example, the browser might open with `localhost:34567` instead of `localhost:34567/mycontextroot`, so type `mycontextroot`. For VS Code and Che, edit and save the `.cw-settings` file, and the context root updates.

## Projects created never start after installing Codewind
Intermittently, after installing Codewind on Windows, projects can be created, but they never start and instead remain in the **Starting** state. A Docker issue for Windows exists where, although it shows a volume is mounted, it does not allow any writing to the volume. To check if this issue is present, verify that a `codewind-data` directory exists in the root of your `C:` drive on Windows and verify you can see your Appsody project folders created within.

**Workaround:** This issue can appear for many reasons, so you have many possible workarounds. First, open the `Docker\Settings\Shared Drives` directory to confirm that your `C:` drive is selected. If it is not selected, select it, click **Apply**, and then try creating projects again. If you're still noticing the problem, and you're using an ID for the shared drive that is not your current user, check that the ID being used doesn't have an expired password that requires a password reset. Reset the password if necessary.

## Appsody and Docker Desktop on Windows 10
When you use Appsody, configure Docker Desktop to access your `C:` drive that contains your `codewind-data` directory. In most cases, you can configure Docker with the same user as the user who develops applications with Appsody. However, if you use Windows 10 Enterprise secured with Azure Active Directory (AAD), the AAD user does not reside in the localhost and might not be accepted in the **Shared Drives** tab of the Docker Desktop **Settings** page, especially if the organization configured AAD to issue only PIN codes instead of user passwords.

**Workaround** Complete the instructions in [Special notes about Appsody and Docker Desktop on Windows 10](https://github.com/gcharters/kabanero-dev-getting-started/blob/master/docker-windows-aad.md).

## Node.js and Swift templates remain in the starting state
The templates `Appsody Node.js template` and `Appsody Swift template` remain in the starting state by default because these templates do not have a server implemented, and therefore, its status cannot be detected. These templates do not have a server and are intended to help you implement your own server.

**Workaround** To get the application into a **Started** state, use a server for the application. After the application has a server, Codewind can monitor the server, and the status turns to **Started** if the server is running. Alternatively, you can also temporarily [stop Codewind from continueously pinging the application](#how-to-stop-the-app-from-continuously-pinging).

If you work with Appsody projects in Codewind for VS Code, you might encounter `Classpath is incomplete` warnings or notifications that application classes are not on the classpath.

**Workaround** Add the project's parent folder to the VS Code workspace. 
1. After you create an Appsody Java MicroProfile project, right-click and `Add Project to Workspace` if it is not already added. 
2. Right-click on the project from the workspace view and select **Add Folder to Workspace...** and choose the parent folder of the project. Click `Add`.

## Starting in debug mode results in failure to attach the debugger
If you work with Appsody projects in Codewind, and if you restart the project in debug mode, the first attempt to attach the debugger might fail.

**Workaround** Run the `Attach Debugger` action manually. The following sample steps show instructions for VS Code. The steps to manually attach the debugger in other IDEs is similar:
1. After you create a project, wait for VS Code to display the project's state as **Running**.
2. Then, right-click the project and select **Restart in Debug Mode**.
3. Allow the process to finish. It fails, and a connection exception window appears.
4. The `Restarting <my_project> into debug mode` message is displayed. Wait for this restart notification to disappear.
5. To manually set the debugger, click the **Debug** tab and then **Play**. The debugger is successfully attached to the project if `Debug <my_project>` is displayed in the message bar or if the project's state shows **Debugging**.

## Appsody binds fail

If an Appsody repository is already added in your local Appsody CLI, the Appsody bind might fail.

These steps create the issue:
1. The Appsody repository was added to your local Appsody CLI. The same Appsody repository was then added to Codewind from your IDE by right-clicking **Projects (Local)** and then clicking **Manage Template Sources**.
2. Later, a project was bound to a stack from the added Appsody repository. The project appears in the Codewind Explorer view, and the `appsody.log` displays this error:
```
[Error] The current directory is not a valid appsody project. Run `appsody init <stack>` to create one. Run `appsody list` to see the available stacks.
```
Codewind displays an error. In VS Code, the error appears in the Codewind log:
```
2019/11/08 11:07:29 Please wait while the command runs... 
2019/11/08 11:07:31 [Error] Repository 77b94c9b-0daf-5426-98b8-83eb8ee63e3c is not in configured list of repositories
```

**Workaround**
1. Remove the repository from the local Appsody CLI. For example, run the `appsody repo remove` command.
2. Remove and add the repository back into Codewind with **Manage Template Sources**.
3. Rebind the project to Codewind.

## Using Appsody stacks images from private Docker registries

**Local scenario**
For Codewind to work with an Appsody stack image on a private Docker registry, the stack must fully qualify the image name in the `.appsody-config.yaml` configuration of its template, for example: `hostname[:port]/username/reponame[:tag]`. Also, before you work with the stack, on the local system, enter `docker login` to the private registry.
- **Note:** When you view the application log, you might see failures to pull the image during a rebuild. However, Codewind is taking the cached container image from your local machine. If you ever delete that image, you need to pull the image again. You can either create another project from the same stack or manually call a `docker pull` with the required image.

**Remote scenario**
Follow the instructions in [Adding a container registry in Codewind](che-setupregistries.html).

## Open Liberty projects do not start within the default timeout

Occasionally, Appsody Open Liberty projects do not start, and you see the following entries in the `appsody.log`:

```
[Container] [INFO] CWWKM2010I: Searching for CWWKF0011I: in /opt/ol/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/logs/messages.log. This search will timeout after 120 seconds.
[Container] [INFO] CWWKM2013I: The file /opt/ol/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/logs/messages.log being validated does not exist.
...
[Container] [INFO] CWWKM2011E: Timed out searching for CWWKF0011I: in /opt/ol/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer/logs/messages.log.
```

By default, Open liberty projects are configured to wait 2 minutes (120 seconds) for the server to start up.  The messages above is an indication that the server did not start up within the default timeout period.

**Workaround**

You can increase the timeout value in the project's `pom.xml` file.  Look for the element below and increase the value:

```
<serverStartTimeout>120</serverStartTimeout>
```

**Workaround** Go to the `Che workspace` dashboard, log out of the Che workspace, and then log back in to the Che workspace. Access the Codewind workspace.

## Che sometimes fails to reinstall successfully on Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud
Sometimes when Che is reinstalled on Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, the installation might fail with the following error:
```
 ✔ Create Che Cluster eclipse-che in namespace che...done.
  ❯ ✅  Post installation checklist
    ❯ PostgreSQL pod bootstrap
      ✔ scheduling...done.
      ✔ downloading images...done.
      ✖ starting
        → ERR_TIMEOUT: Timeout set to pod ready timeout 130000
```

This error appears because of permissions issues in the namespace.

**Workaround:** To resolve the error, install Che into a namespace other than `che` with the `--chenamespace` flag when running `chectl server:start`.

## Codewind cannot access the Tekton dashboard URL

If you install Codewind before you install Tekton, Codewind cannot access the Tekton dashboard URL. In the logs, you see the following error message: 

```sh
Tekton dashboard does not appear to be installed on this cluster. Please install Tekton dashboard on your cluster, and restart your Codewind Che workspace. 
```

These steps reproduce the issue:
1. Install Codewind on OpenShift.
2. Install Tekton Pipelines.
3. Click **Open Tekton dashboard URL**. Codewind does not access the Tekton dashboard URL. 

**Workaround:** 
1. Go to the Eclipse Che workspace console.  
2. Select your workspace and stop it. 
3. After 2 minutes, start your workspace again. 
4. Now, access the Tekton dashboard URL from the Codewind palette.

## OpenAPI generation fails in Eclipse if the output path does not exist
In Eclipse, OpenAPI generation fails if a path does not exist, and the wizard doesn't automatically create the folder tree hierarchy if the hierarchy doesn't already exist. 

These steps reproduce the issue:
1. Install the latest version of Codewind.
2. Add a sample OpenAPI `.yaml` file.
3. From the Project or Package Explorer views, right-click the project and select one of the generator actions in **OpenAPI Generate**. A dialog window appears.
4. In the dialog window, if necessary, select the OpenAPI definition file by clicking the **Browse...** button.
5. In the **Output folder** field, copy and paste a path or edit the path directly.
6. Click **Finish**. The OpenAPI generator fails if the folder doesn't already exist.

**Workaround:**
For the VS Code extension, manually create the output folder before you start the OpenAPI generator wizard. In the wizard, you can also create the **Output folder** in the browse dialog. Ensure that the path points to a valid folder in the project.

For post-client or post-server stub generation, use a separate output folder for code generation. Depending on the language and the generator type, the OpenAPI generator generates both source code files and build-related files. Some refactoring might be necessary. For example, move the generated source code to the proper source folder that already exists in the project. However, if your project is empty, the target output folder can be the root of the project, and you don’t need to do as much refactoring and merging. 

For Eclipse, for Java-based code generators, the Open API wizards provide additional support to configure the project. It is recommended that the project's root folder is selected as the output folder of the generator so that `.java` files will be generated into the existing `src/main/java` and `src/test/java` folders. The wizard's default value of the output folder is the project's root folder. The wizard also performs some automatic configuration, including `pom.xml` file merging, and necessary updates to the project's classpath.

Action/Topic: Plugin execution validation error in the pom.xml file for Open API tools
Issue type: bug
Issue link: https://github.com/eclipse/codewind/issues/650
0.5.0: New issue
-->
## Plugin execution validation error in the pom.xml file
When generating a Java client or server stub into an existing Appsody or Codewind Liberty Microprofile project, you might see a plugin execution validation error in the `pom.xml` file:

```sh
Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: org.codehaus.mojo:aspectj-maven-plugin:1.0:compile (execution: default, phase: process-classes)
```

The build is successful even though the validator reports this issue. 

**Workaround:** To resolve this in Eclipse, surround the plugins element under the `build` element of the `pom.xml` file with the `pluginManagement` element.

```xml
<build>
    <pluginManagement>
        <plugins>   
        ...
```

The following workaround applies to Eclipse. Add the configuration element to the `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <configuration>
                    <mainClass>org.openapitools.OpenAPI2SpringBoot</mainClass>
                </configuration>
                ....             
```

## Assisting with problem determination by raising the default Codewind server log level
To assist with problem determination, raise the default Codewind server log level to **Debug** or **Trace**. Use the `cwctl loglevels` command or follow the instructions for an IDE:
- In Eclipse, enable support features in the Codewind preferences, then right-click the connection in the Codewind Explorer view and click **Codewind server log level**.
- In VS Code, use the **Codewind: Set Codewind Server Logging Level** command in the Command Palette.
