## Installer fails with mount issues on Windows
If you try to install Codewind on Windows 10 and use Docker, you might see the following error:

```sh
ERROR: for codewind-performance  Cannot start service codewind-performance: b"error while creating mount source path '/host_mnt/c/codewind-workspace': mkdir /host_mnt/c: file exists"

ERROR: for codewind-performance  Cannot start service codewind-performance: b"error while creating mount source path '/host_mnt/c/codewind-workspace': mkdir /host_mnt/c: file exists"
Encountered errors while bringing up the project.
```

**Workaround:**
Enter the following command and install again:
1. Enter the `docker volume rm -f /host_mnt/c` command.
2. Restart Docker and run the installer again.

If the command and another installation attempt don't succeed, complete the following steps instead:
1. Uninstall Codewind and remove all the images with the `docker system prune -a` command.
2. From the Docker settings dialog box, reset Docker to the factory default to resolve the mount issues.

For more information, see [this issue about Docker mounts on Windows](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/1560).

## Docker Shared Drive not accepting OS credentials for Windows
When using OS authentication setups (for example, AzureAD), Docker Shared Drive might not accept your OS credentials.

**Workaround:** Create a new user account.
1. Navigate to **Settings** -> **Accounts** -> **Family & other people** -> **Add someone else to this PC** -> **I don't have this person's sign-in information** -> **Add a user without a Microsoft account**.
2. Create the new account with the same username but without the prefix (for example, if your AzureAD account is `AzureAD/BobSmith`, your new local account should be `BobSmith`). Use the same password as your other account.
3. Select your new local account and click **Change account type**. Select the dropdown menu and select **Administrator**. Share the drive again in Docker.

## Projects created never start after installing Codewind
Intermittently, after installing Codewind on Windows, projects can be created, but they never start and instead remain in the **Starting** state. A Docker issue for Windows exists where, although it shows a volume is mounted, it does not allow any writing to the volume. To check if this issue is present, verify that a `codewind-workspace` exists (in your $HOME directory on Mac/Linux, or the root of your C: directory on Windows) and verify you can see your project folders created within.

**Workaround:** This issue can appear for many reasons, so you have many possible workarounds. First, open the `Docker`->`Settings`->`Shared Drives` directory to confirm that you have a shared drive. If you have one selected, unselect it, click **Apply**, and then try creating projects again. If you're still noticing the problem, and you're using an ID for the shared drive that is not your current user, check that the ID being used doesn't have an expired password that requires a password reset. Reset the password if necessary.

## Project creation on macOS fails, and Codewind reports an error
If creating a Codewind project on macOS fails, Codewind might report the `net/http: TLS handshake timeout` error. You might encounter the same issue if you run `codewind-installer` from the Terminal. For a similar issue, see the report [Error "net/http: TLS handshake timeout"](https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/99219/error-net-http-tls-handshake-timeout).

**Workaround**
As noted in the report [Error "net/http: TLS handshake timeout"](https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/99219/error-net-http-tls-handshake-timeout), go to **Applications**>**Utilities**>**Keychain Access** and delete from the keychain the certificates that you no longer need. You might notice that some certificates are redundant. Then, restart Codewind.

## Projects stuck in starting or stopped state
You might occasionally see projects stuck in the `Starting` or `Stopped` state even though the container logs say the projects are up and running. This can happen when you create a number of projects, for example, using the default and Appsody templates with Codewind 0.5.0. 

**Workaround** Manually rebuild the projects that are stuck in `Starting` or `Stopped` state. To do this: 
1. In the **Codewind Explorer** view, right-click your project and select **Build**.
2. Wait for the project state to return to **Running** or **Debugging** in the **Codewind Explorer** view.

## Application Monitoring unavailable after Project Import
After importing an application, when you click `App Monitor`, the dashboard is not displayed and results in a `Cannot GET /appmetrics-dash/` error. If this error appears, the application was not created by Codewind or previously had AppMetrics integration.

**Workaround:** Enable AppMetrics for your application. You can enable AppMetrics for [Node.js](https://developer.ibm.com/node/monitoring-post-mortem/application-metrics-node-js/), [Swift](https://developer.ibm.com/swift/monitoring-diagnostics/application-metrics-for-swift/), and [SpringBoot](https://github.com/RuntimeTools/javametrics#spring-boot) projects.

## Profiling markers do not appear
If you have the Codewind Language Server for Node.js Profiling extension enabled and have run a load test, profiling markers still might not appear. Ensure that your project and load run conform to the following requirements to use profiling:
- Your project exists in Theia or VS Code. Profiling is available only in Theia and VS Code.
- Your project is a Node.js project that was created through Codewind.
- Your project has `Run Load` executed on it.
- The load run successfully completed. Profiling data is written to the `load-test/<datestamp>/profiling.json` file in your Codewind project only on a successfully completed load run. If the load run was cancelled, it won't be written to the workspace.
- The load run ran for a minimum of 45 seconds to gather enough profiling data to generate the `profiling.json` file.
- If a function runs quickly, in less than 5 milliseconds with the default configuration, then the function might not run during any of the samples, so it might not be included in the profiling data for that load run.
- Profiling is not disabled. To enable profiling, access the profiling in one of the following ways:
  - Right-click in the editor and select `Toggle Profiling`.
  - Open the command palette with `cmd+shift+p` on a Mac or `ctrl+shift+p` on Windows. Then, select `Codewind: Profiling: Toggle Profiling`.
  - Toggle the `Codewind Profiling: Show Profiling` setting in the extensions settings.

**Workaround:** Review the preceding list and ensure that your project conforms to all of the items in the list.

## MicroProfile project gets updated twice upon file change
If you modify files in MicroProfile projects, sometimes the project gets double updates. You might see the application status changed from **Running** to **Stopped** twice. If you notice this status change, the default polling rate, which is 500 ms, is too short for the application monitor.

**Workaround:** Increase the polling rate in the `server.xml` file to 1000 ms or longer.

```xml

## Context Root / Application Endpoint not correct
If you create or bind a project which has a context root set in `.cw-settings`, such as a project using the Lagom template, the context root is not picked up initially. This also happens after restarting Codewind.

**Workaround** For Eclipse. add the context root to the URL in your browser. For example, the browser might open with `localhost:34567` instead of `localhost:34567/mycontextroot` so type `mycontextroot`. For VS Code and Theia, edit and save the `.cw-settings` file, and the context root updates.

## Appsody and Docker Desktop on Windows 10
When you use Appsody, configure Docker Desktop to access the shared drive that contains your home directory and that you associated with the shared drive. In most cases, you can configure Docker with the same user as the user who develops applications with Appsody. However, if you use Windows 10 Enterprise secured with Azure Active Directory (AAD), the AAD user does not reside in the local host and might not be accepted in the **Shared Drives** tab of the Docker Desktop **Settings** page, especially if the organization configured AAD to issue only PIN codes instead of user passwords.

**Workaround** Complete the instructions in [Special notes about Appsody and Docker Desktop on Windows 10](https://github.com/gcharters/kabanero-dev-getting-started/blob/master/docker-windows-aad.md).

## Node.js and Swift templates go from the starting state and then to the stopped state by default
The templates `Appsody Node.js template` and `Appsody Swift template` go from the starting state to the stopped state by default. The application stops, but the container still runs. These templates do not have a server and are intended to help you implement your own server.

**Workaround** To get the application into a started state, use a server for the application. After the application has a server, Codewind can monitor the server, and the status turns to `started` if the server is running.

## A project build error appears after you create an initial project
If you use Eclipse and either Java MicroProfile or Spring Appsody templates, you might receive a `Project build error: Non-resolvable parent POM` error after you create the initial project.

**Workaround** Complete the following instructions to work around the error:
1. Right-click the project and select **Show Log Files**>**Show All**.
2. If your `.m2` cache is empty, or if you have not previously created a Java Appsody project, the dependencies will download, and the `[Container] Installing parent dev.appsody` message appears.
3. Wait until the cache completes. You can wait until the Project status is `Running`, or, if you use the MicroProfile template, you can wait until the `Liberty defaultServer` starts.
4. Right-click the **Project** from the Project Explorer and select **Maven**>**Update Project...**.
5. Accept the defaults and click **OK**. The project is configured, and the `Project build error: Non-resolvable parent POM` disappears.

After you create the initial project and set the `.m2` cache, new projects begin to be configured properly.

## Classpath warnings appear or the application classes are not on the classpath
If you work with Appsody projects in Codewind for VS Code, you might encounter `Classpath is incomplete` warnings or notifications that application classes are not on the classpath.

**Workaround** Add the `codewind-workspace` folder to the workspace:
1. After you create an Appsody Java MicroProfile project, open the `codewind-workspace` folder.
2. Right-click the `codewind-workspace` folder and select **Add Folder to Workspace...**.
3. Choose the project folder and click **Add**.

## Starting in debug mode results in failure to attach the debugger
If you work with Appsody projects in Codewind for VS Code, you might receive messages that state, `Failed to attach to remote debuggee VM` or `Failed to attach debugger` when you start a project in debug mode.

**Workaround** Run the `Attach Debugger` action manually:
1. After you create a project, wait for VS Code to display, `Running [Build succeeded]`.
2. Then, right-click the project and select **Restart in Debug Mode**.
3. Allow the process to finish. It fails, and a connection exception window appears.
4. The `Restarting <my_project> into debug mode` message is displayed. Wait for this restart notification to disappear.
5. To manually set the debugger, click the **Debug** tab and then **Play**. The debugger is successfully attached to the project if `Debug appsody-mp (codewind-workspace) Cloud Code -- NORMAL --` is displayed in the message bar.

## Appsody mount errors on Windows Enterprise
If you use Windows Enterprise and authenticate through Azure Active Directory (AAD), you might see mount errors when you use any of the Java Appsody stacks, such as `java-microprofile` or `java-spring-boot2`.

You might receive an error message in the `appsody.log` file when you try to create an Appsody project:
```
[Container] docker: Error response from daemon: error while creating mount source path '/C/Users/<user name>/.m2/repository': mkdir /C/Users/<user name>/.m2: permission denied.
```

**Workaround:** Configure the Maven `.m2` cache to be outside of your home directory. If you log in to your Windows machine as an Azure user, and you want to create Appsody applications, set the global `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable before you start Eclipse or VS Code.
- Example: `MAVEN_OPTS=-Dmaven.repo.local=C:\somefolder\.m2\repository`

These steps reproduce the issue:
1. Set up a project extension environment and create a Microprofile project.
2. Restart the project in debug mode. You receive one or both of the following error messages: `Failed to attach to remote debuggee VM` or `Failed to attach debugger to at ipaddress:`.

**Workaround** Run the `Attach Debugger` action manually.

## OpenAPI generation fails in Eclipse if the output path does not exist
In Eclipse, OpenAPI generation fails if a path does not exist, and the wizard doesn't automatically create the folder tree hierarchy if the hierarchy doesn't already exist. 

These steps reproduce the issue:
1. Install the latest version of Codewind.
2. Add a sample OpenAPI `.yaml` file.
3. From the Project or Package Explorer views, right-click the project and select one of the generator actions in **OpenAPI Generate**. A dialog window appears.
4. In the dialog window, if necessary, select the OpenAPI definition file by clicking the **Browse...** button.
5. In the **Output folder** field, copy and paste a path or edit the path directly.
6. Click **Finish**. The OpenAPI generator fails if the folder doesn't already exist.

**Workaround:**
For the VS Code extension, manually create the output folder before you start the OpenAPI generator wizard. In the wizard, you can also create the **Output folder** in the browse dialog. Ensure that the path points to a valid folder in the project.

For post-client or post-server stub generation, use a separate output folder for code generation. Depending on the language and the generator type, the OpenAPI generator generates both source code files and build-related files. Some refactoring might be necessary. For example, move the generated source code to the proper source folder that already exists in the project. However, if your project is empty, the target output folder can be the root of the project, and you don’t need to do as much refactoring and merging. 

For Eclipse, for Java-based code generators, the Open API wizards provide additional support to configure the project. It is recommended that the project's root folder is selected as the output folder of the generator so that `.java` files will be generated into the existing `src/main/java` and `src/test/java` folders. The wizard's default value of the output folder is the project's root folder. The wizard also performs some automatic configuration, including `pom.xml` file merging, and necessary updates to the project's classpath.

Action/Topic: Plugin execution validation error in the pom.xml file for Open API tools
Issue type: bug
Issue link: https://github.com/eclipse/codewind/issues/650
0.5.0: New issue
-->
## Plugin execution validation error in the pom.xml file
When generating a Java client or server stub into an existing Appsody or Codewind Liberty Microprofile project, you might see a plugin execution validation error in the `pom.xml` file:

```sh
Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: org.codehaus.mojo:aspectj-maven-plugin:1.0:compile (execution: default, phase: process-classes)
```

The build is successful even though the validator reports this issue. 

**Workaround:** To resolve this in Eclipse, surround the plugins element under the `build` element of the `pom.xml` file with the `pluginManagement` element.

```xml
<build>
    <pluginManagement>
        <plugins>   
        ...
```

The following work-around applies to both VS Code and Eclipse. The spring server generator creates invalid source in the `OpenAPI2SpringBoot` class. Simply implement the methods from the interface and save the file. Also add the configuration element to the `pom.xml` file, like this:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <configuration>
                    <mainClass>org.openapitools.OpenAPI2SpringBoot</mainClass>
                </configuration>
                ....             
```
