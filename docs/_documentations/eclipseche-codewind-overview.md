# Overview: Using Codewind as a hosted application on the cloud

Codewind can be used in one of three ways - [locally](./local-codewind-overview.html), hosted as an application on a cloud, or [remotely](./remote-codewind-overview.html). 

By using Codewind hosted as an application on the cloud, you can develop, build and run your code all by accessing Codewind via a browser window from your local desktop.
