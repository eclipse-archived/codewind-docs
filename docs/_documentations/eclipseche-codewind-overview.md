# Overview: Using Codewind as a hosted application on the cloud

Codewind can be used in one of three ways - [locally](./vsc-getting-started.html), hosted as an application on a cloud, or [remotely](./remote-codewind-overview.html). 

By using **Codewind hosted as an application on the cloud**, you can develop, build and run your code all by accessing Codewind via a browser window from your local desktop.

Follow the instructions to get started with using Codewind as an application hosted on the cloud. This will guide you through:

1. Installing Eclipse Che to use with Codewind or preparing to use Codewind with an existing Eclipse Che installation
2. Creating a Codewind connection by (i) adding an image registry and (ii) creating a Codewind workspace in Eclipse Che
3. Creating a Codewind workspace in Eclipse Che
4. Creating your first Codewind project 

### Next Steps

[Install Eclipse Che to use with Codewind](./che-installinfo.html), or [prepare to use Codewind with an existing Eclipse Che installation](./che-installinfo.html). 

**A quick way to try out Codewind before installing Codewind as a hosted application in your cloud is to use Codewind locally** In this fully-local configuration, you create, develop, build and run your containerised applications on your local machine using your local IDE. See [Getting Started with Codewind](./gettingstarted.html) for local IDE options and step-by- step instructions.

**Using Codewind Remotely** If you want to use the other cloud-based configuration of Codewind, **you must first follow the steps to [install codewind locally](./gettingstarted.html)**. By [using Codewind remotely](./remote-codewind-overview.html), Codewind is configured for making code changes on your local IDE but building and running your application in the cloud.
