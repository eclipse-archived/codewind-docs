# Making a code change with IntelliJ
Codewind automatically builds and redeploys your application whenever you make a code change and save the file. To see this feature in action, make a change to a file:
1. From a project, open the file that you want to edit, for example, **Project1**>**src**>**main**>**java**>**application**>**rest**>**v1**>**example**.
2. Edit your file.
3. Save your changes. By default, IntelliJ automatically saves your changes. However, if you manually save your changes, you can help Codewind detect changes more quickly.
4. Open the application again. Your changes appear.
