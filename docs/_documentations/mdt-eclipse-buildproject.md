# Codewind build logs

If you enable auto build for a project, Codewind for Eclipse, Eclipse Che, and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) detects when you make a change and starts a build automatically. If you have disabled auto build for a project, you can start a build manually when you have made a change or a set of changes:

1. Right-click your project in the **Codewind Explorer** view > select **Build**.
2. Wait for the project state to return to **Running** or **Debugging** in the **Codewind Explorer** view and then test your changes.
