## Objectives
* Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Codewind
* Develop a simple microservice, using Eclipse Codewind on VS Code

## Overview
Eclipse Codewind provides the ability to create application projects from `Application Stacks` that your company has built, enabling developers to focus on their code and not infrastructure and Kubernetes. Application deployments to Kubernetes occur via pipelines when developers commit their local code to the correct Git repos Kabanero is managing via webhooks.

Eclipse Codewind provides the ability to create projects based on a variety of different template types.  These include IBM Cloud starters, OpenShift Do (odo), and Appsody templates. Today, there are templates for: IBM Cloud Starters, odo, Eclipse MicroProfile/Java EE, Springboot, Node.js, Node.js with Express, and Node.js with Loopback.

## Developing with VS Code
You can use Codewind for VS Code to develop and debug your containerized projects from within VS Code using the workflow you already use today.

### Prerequisite
Before you can develop a microservice with VS Code, you need to:

* [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
    * **Note:** Make sure to install or upgrade to minimum Docker version 19.03.
* [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Installing Codewind for VS Code
The Codewind installation pulls the following images that form the Codewind backend:

1. `eclipse/codewind-performance-amd64`
2. `eclipse/codewind-pfe-amd64`

The Codewind installation includes two parts:

1. The VS Code extension installs when you install Codewind from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=IBM.codewind) and click `Install`.
    * Or, go to `View->Extensions`, search for Codewind, and click `Install`.
2. The Codewind backend containers install after you click `Install` when you are prompted. Clicking `Install` downloads the Codewind backend containers, ~1GB.
    * **Optional:** If you donâ€™t click `Install` when the notification window first appears, you can access the notification again. Go to `View->Explorer`. Then click `Codewind` and hover the cursor over `Codewind` where there is a switch to turn Codewind on or off. Click the switch so that it is `On`. The notification window is displayed.

### Configuring Codewind to use application stacks
Configure Codewind to use Appsody templates so you can focus exclusively on your code. These templates include an Eclipse MicroProfile stack that you can use to follow this guide. Complete the following steps to select the Appsody templates:

1. Under the Explorer pane, select `Codewind`.
2. Right-click `Local`.
3. Select `Template Source Manager`.
4. Enable `Appsody Stacks - incubator`.

You have now configured Codewind to use Appsody templates and can proceed to develop your microservice within Codewind.

If your organization uses customized application stacks and has given you a URL that points to an `index.json` file, you can add it to Codewind:

1. Return to  `Codewind` and right-click `Local`.
2. Select `Template Source Manager`.
3. Click the `Add New +` button to add your URL.
4. Add your URL in the pop up window and save your changes.

### Creating an Appsody project
Throughout the application lifestyle, Appsody helps you develop containerized applications and leverage containers curated for your usage. If you want more context about Appsody, visit the [Appsody welcome page](https://appsody.dev/docs).

1. Under the Explorer pane, select `Codewind`.
2. Expand `Codewind` by clicking the drop-down arrow.
3. Hover over the `Projects` entry underneath Codewind in the Explorer pane, and press the `+` icon to create a project.
    * **Note:** Make sure Docker is running. Otherwise, you get an error.
4. Choose the `Open Liberty (Default templates)`.
5. Name your project `appsody-calculator`.
    * If you don't see Appsody templates, find and select `Template Source Manager` and enable `Appsody Stacks - appsodyhub`.
    * The templates are refreshed, and the Appsody templates are available.
6. Press `Enter`.
    * To monitor your project's progress, right-click your project, and select `Show all logs`. Then an `Output` tab is displayed where you see your project's build logs.

Your project is complete when you see your application status is running and your build status is successful.

### Accessing the application endpoint in a browser
1. Return to your project under the Explorer pane.
2. Select the Open App icon next to your project's name, or right-click your project and select `Open App`.

Your application is now opened in a browser, showing the welcome to your Appsody microservice page.

### Adding a REST service to your application
 1. Go to your project's workspace under the Explorer tab.
 2. Navigate to `src->main->java->dev->appsody->starter`.
 3. Right-click `starter` and select `New File`.
 4. Create a file, name it `Calculator.java`, and press `Enter`. This file is your JAX-RS resource.
 5. Populate the file with the following code and then **save** the file:

```java
package dev.appsody.starter;

import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;

import javax.ws.rs.PathParam;

@Path("/calculator")
public class Calculator extends Application {

    @GET
    @Path("/aboutme")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String aboutme() {
        return "You can add (+), subtract (-), and multiply (*) with this simple calculator.";
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/{op}/{a}/{b}")
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public Response calculate(@PathParam("op") String op, @PathParam("a") String a, @PathParam("b") String b) {
        int numA = Integer.parseInt(a);
        int numB = Integer.parseInt(b);

        switch (op) {
            case "+":
                return Response.ok(a + "+" + b + "=" + (Integer.toString((numA + numB)))).build();

            case "-":
                return Response.ok(a + "-" + b + "=" + (Integer.toString((numA - numB)))).build();

            case "*":
                return Response.ok(a + "*" + b + "=" + (Integer.toString((numA * numB)))).build();

            default:
                return Response.ok("Invalid operation. Please Try again").build();
        }
    }
}
```

Any changes you make to your code are automatically built and re-deployed by Codewind and you can view them in your browser.

### Working with the example calculator microservice
You now can work with the example calculator microservice.

1. Use the port number you saw when you first opened the application.
2. Make sure to remove the `< >` symbol in the URL.
3. `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/starter/calculator/aboutme`
4. You see the following response:

```
You can add (+), subtract (-), and multiply (*) with this simple calculator.
```

You can also try a few of the sample calculator functions:

* `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/starter/calculator/{op}/{a}/{b}`, where you can input one of the available operations `(+, _, *)`, and an integer a, and an integer b.
* So for `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/starter/calculator/+/10/3` you see: `10+3=13`.
